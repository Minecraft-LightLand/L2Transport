Lasers will interact with the block through the face the laser shoots into. (pretending it's a full block). Similarly, for other blocks that dedicate each side to a specific purpose or slot, you would need to have laser pointing from that direction."

Simple Item Node is an intermediate node that pass the item forward having its own cool down. Extension Node is a shadow reference of the target block's target face, allowing any interaction without cool down."
